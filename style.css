/*
 * Tailwind CSS Configuration and Custom Styles
 *
 * NOTE: When running a production build of Tailwind, you would typically 
 * put the @tailwind directives here and use the CLI to process them.
 * For this example, we rely on the CDN in index.html to load the framework,
 * and we only define the custom colors and the grid background here.
*/

/* * 1. Tailwind Configuration (Injecting via CSS/JS config)
 * * Since the CDN version is used in index.html, the configuration 
 * for custom colors ('dark-blue-bg', 'neon-blue', 'card-bg') 
 * is embedded in the <script> tag in the HTML file to ensure they are available.
 * * If you were using a local Tailwind build (recommended for production), 
 * this config would be in your tailwind.config.js file.
*/

/* * 2. Custom Styles
*/

/* Custom dark background pattern to match the design aesthetics */
